# Day Seven
## Objectives - Learn about scope, libraries, and modules. Build your first library.
1. Recap - 10min
    - Q&A
    - Algorithm solutions
2. Scope - 10min
    -  How does scope work in js?
        - function scoping
    - Nested scope (functions within functions).
    - A few examples using print statements.
3. Libraries and Modules - 15min
    - Brief overview of libraries/modules (reading material on platform).
    - Common ways to organize functions/files/style.
        - Indentation
        - Naming conventions
            - Languages have specific conventions
        - Why does style matter?
            - Readability
            - Makes development faster
        - Single responsibility principle
        - When is a creating my own module right for me?
        - When is a 3rd party library right for me?
4. Our first library - 5min
    - Write a module using the "revealing module pattern" (see platform).
    - Throw some simple math functions in there (fibonnaci, sigma, factorial).
5. Breakout rooms - 15min
    - Tell students to pair program in breakout rooms.
    - Have them move their code from yesterday into a library and experiment with running the functions inside it.
