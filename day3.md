# Day Three
## Description - Writing Algorithm Solutions
## Objectives - Write solutions to our first algorithms problems.
1. Recap - 20min
    - Q&A
    - Predict the output answers
2. Why algorithms? - 5min
3. Objects Basics - 10min
    - Getting/Setting values
    - Nested objects/arrays
4. Helpful Tidbits - 5min
    - Modulo
    - && || ! revisited
5. Starting Function Writing - 10min
    1. Understand the problem
        - What are the important questions?
        - How would we do it as a human?
    2. Divide and conquer
        - How can we divide the human process into tiny discrete steps?
        - Can we turn those steps into questions that relate to the code?
            - How do we do something multiple times?
            - How do we remember something?
    3. Pseudo-code
        - How can we use those answers to create a step-by-step plan?
        - Write a rough draft that's code adjacent.
    4. Test and Debug
        - Errors are our friends
        - T-Diagrams + debugging
6. Solve Some Algorithms - 15min
    - Breakout rooms.
