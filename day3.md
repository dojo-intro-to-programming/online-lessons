# Day Three
## Objectives - Write solutions to our first algorithms problems.
1. Recap - 10min
    - Q&A
    - Predict the output answers
2. Why algorithms? - 5min
3. Starting Function Writing - 10min
    1. Understand the problem
        - What are the important questions?
        - Draw it out, figure out how you would explain the problem to someone else
        - How would we do it as a human?
    2. Divide and conquer
        - How can we divide the big questions into smaller questions and answer them?
    3. Pseudo-code
        - How can we use those answers to create a step-by-step plan?
    4. Test and Debug
        - Errors are our friends
        - T-Diagrams + debugging
4. Solve Some Algorithms - 15min
    - Breakout rooms.
